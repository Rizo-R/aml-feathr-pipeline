# jobs:
# - job: A
#   steps:
#   # assume that MyTask generates an output variable called "MyVar"
#   # (you would learn that from the task's documentation)
#   - task: MyTask@1
#     name: ProduceVar  # because we're going to depend on it, we need to name the step
# - job: B
#   dependsOn: A
#   variables:
#     # map the output variable from A into this job
#     varFromA: $[ dependencies.A.outputs['ProduceVar.MyVar'] ]
#   steps:
#   - script: echo $(varFromA) # this step uses the mapped-in variable
