# Azure MLOps (v2) Pattern: Azure Machine Learning - Classical Machine Learning

This repository includes all use case specific codebase to be deployed as the inner loop for the [MLOps v2](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2) solution accelerator.

The repo itself functions as a standalone entity that agnosticly holds all Azure Machine Learning - Classical Machine Learning requirements for this architectual pattern.


## üìê Pattern Architectures: Key concepts

This repository follows the architecture linked below:

## üë§ Getting started

Please visit [MLOps v2](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2) for the initial deployment of this inner loop pattern.

## Upload data (required manual step between deployment of infrastructure and rest of MLops lifecycle)

- navigate to the `data` folder in this repo and locate the `nyc_taxi.parquet` file

- Navigate to Azure Portal and open the storage account created in the feature store resource group, it should start with `st...` not the one with `stlog...`

- Click on "Container" and then click on "+ Container", name the container `nyctaxi` and upload the data `nyc_taxi.parquet` file to this new container

In real world projects: you would have these existing data containers as an output from another data engineering process and then you would use Feathr to point to that data location (and do feature enfgineering from there)


## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Feedback or Issues

Please visit [MLOps v2](https://github.com/Azure/mlops-v2) and file an **issue** or go to Microsofts internal SharePoint site to hand in any feedback.
